# Explanation of Python Code

## Reading Stock Prices from CSV

The code begins by reading stock prices from a CSV file named `stock_prices.csv`. It first initializes an empty list called `stock_price`. Then, it reads each line from the file, splits it by comma (`,`) to separate the day and price tokens, converts the price to a float, and appends the day and price as a list `[day, price]` to the `stock_price` list. After reading all lines, it prints the `stock_price`.

```python
stock_price = []
with open("stock_prices.csv","r") as f:
    for line in f:
        tokens = line.split(",")
        day = tokens[0]
        price = float(tokens[1])
        stock_price.append([day,price])

print(stock_price)
```

```

## Accessing Prices for Specific Days

The code then iterates over each element in the `stock_price` list. If the day matches `"march 9"`, it prints the corresponding price.

```python
for element in stock_price:
    if element[0] == "march 9":
        print(element[1])
        
```

## Using Dictionary to Store Stock Prices

Next, the code uses a dictionary `stock_price` to store stock prices. It reads each line from the CSV file similarly to the previous method but instead stores the day as a key and the price as the corresponding value in the dictionary.

```python
stock_price = {}
with open("stock_prices.csv","r") as f:
    for line in f:
        tokens = line.split(",")
        day = tokens[0]
        price = float(tokens[1])
        stock_price[day] = price

print(stock_price["march 9"])
```

## Simple Hash Function

The code defines a simple hash function `get_hash()` that takes a key as input and returns a hash value based on the ASCII values of its characters. The hash value is then modulo 100 to limit it within a specific range.

```python
def get_hash(key):
    h = 0 
    for char in key:
        h += ord(char)
    print(h % 100) 
    return 
    

get_hash("a")
get_hash("b")
get_hash("march 6")
```

## Implementation of Hashtable

Finally, the code implements a basic hashtable `Hashtable` using a list to store key-value pairs. It has methods `__setitem__` and `__getitem__` for setting and getting values based on keys, respectively. The `g_hash()` method is used internally to generate a hash value for a given key.

```python
class Hashtable:
    def __init__(self):
     self.MAX = 100
     self.arr = [None for i in range(self.MAX)]

    def g_hash(self,key):
        h = 0 
        for char in key:
            h += ord(char)
        print(h % self.MAX)
        return h % self.MAX

    def __setitem__(self,key,val):
        h = self.g_hash(key)
        self.arr[h] = val
        print(val)

    def __getitem__(self,key):
        h = self.g_hash(key)
        print(self.arr[h])
        return self.arr[h]
```

The `__setitem__` method handles collisions by chaining. If there is already a value for the calculated hash, it appends the new key-value pair to the list at that index.

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, val):
    h = self.g_hash(key)
    if self.arr[h] is None:
        self.arr[h] = [(key, val)]
    else:
        found = False
        for idx, element in enumerate(self.arr[h]):
            if len(element) == 2 and element[0] == key:
                self.arr[h][idx] = (key, val)
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            self.arr[h].append((key, val))
```

## Testing Hashtable

The code creates an instance of the `Hashtable` class and sets and gets some key-value pairs to demonstrate its functionality.

```python
t = Hashtable()
t["march 6"] = 130
t["march 7"] = 30
t["march 9"] = 70
t["march 3"] = 95
t["dec 6"] = 98

print(t.arr)
```
```
