# Explanation of Code

This markdown document explains the functionality of the provided Python code without including the code itself.

## Reading Stock Prices from CSV

The code starts by reading stock prices from a CSV file named "stock_prices.csv". It parses each line of the file, splitting it by commas to extract the day and price tokens. The day is stored as a string and the price as a floating-point number, and then appended as a pair `[day, price]` to the `stock_price` list.

## Accessing Prices for Specific Days

After reading the stock prices, the code iterates through the list `stock_price` to find the price associated with the day "march 9". If the day matches, it prints the corresponding price.

## Storing Stock Prices in a Dictionary

Alternatively, the code also demonstrates storing stock prices in a dictionary named `stock_price`. It follows a similar approach to reading the CSV file but uses the day as the key and the price as the value in the dictionary.

## Simple Hash Function

The code defines a simple hash function `get_hash()` that calculates a hash value based on the ASCII values of the characters in the input key. The hash value is then modulo 100 to limit it within a specific range.

## Implementation of Hashtable

The code implements a basic hashtable named `Hashtable`. It initializes an array (`arr`) of a fixed size (`MAX`) to store key-value pairs. The `g_hash()` method generates a hash value for a given key. It provides methods `__setitem__`, `__getitem__`, and `__delitem__` for setting, getting, and deleting key-value pairs, respectively.

## Testing Hashtable

The code creates an instance of the `Hashtable` class and sets several key-value pairs to demonstrate its functionality. It also deletes a key-value pair to showcase the deletion operation.
